#Mental Fitness Tracker

##Overview
The Mental Fitness Tracker is a machine learning project aimed at predicting mental fitness ratings using various regression models. The project utilizes a dataset with features such as country, year, and percentages of different mental health disorders, including schizophrenia, eating disorders, depression disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorders, etc. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can predict mental fitness ratings based on these features.

##Regression Models
Several regression models were experimented with to test the accuracy of the predictions. These models include:

1.Linear Regression
2.Random Forest Regressor
3.Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

##Best Model: SVR
After comprehensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, the Support Vector Regressor (SVR) emerged as the best performing model for predicting mental fitness ratings. The SVR model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior accuracy, generalization, and robustness compared to the other regression models.

##Features
1.Visualization: The project includes various types of plots, such as joint plots, geographic plots, line charts, bar plots, pie plots, and heat maps, to provide insightful visualizations of the data and model results.

2.Scalability: The model is designed to scale with additional data and adapt to new information for continuous improvement.
